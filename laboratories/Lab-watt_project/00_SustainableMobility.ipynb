    "The National Low-Carbon Strategy ([SNBC](https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/19092_strategie-carbone-EN_oct-20.pdf)) is France's roadmap for reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It concerns all sectors of activity and must be supported by everyone: citizens, local authorities and businesses. The aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a factor of 5 by 2050, compared with 2015 levels. Transport accounts for a significant proportion of these emissions (around 30%) and will therefore have to change if we are to meet these targets. \n",

    "The graph below represents the multiplicative decomposition of the evolution of CO2 emissions from the transport of people and goods from 1960 to 2017. Demand was the main factor explaining the development of emissions over the period, for both passenger and freight transport. The decoupling between demand and emissions is very weak over the period, the other factors having largely offset each other: the factors increasing emissions are the modal shift and the filling of cars, while the filling of heavy goods vehicles, energy efficiency, and carbon intensity is declining.\n",

    "- The modal shift was mainly towards road modes over the period, despite a slight shift towards trains for travelers since the end of the 1990s.\n",
    "- The vehicle occupancy rate has improved for almost all modes with more capacity vehicles, except for cars which are an exception.\n",
    "- The energy efficiency of vehicles has steadily improved, partly offset by significant increases in weight and filling for certain modes.\n",
    "- Carbon intensity has changed little over the period, apart from the end of coal in the railways in the early 1970s, and the development of biofuels, the life cycle analysis of which actually shows emissions similar to oil."
