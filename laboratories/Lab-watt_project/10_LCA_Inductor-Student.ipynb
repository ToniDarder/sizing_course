    "\n",
    "Collecting data for a Life Cycle Inventory can be a time-consuming process. In this study, we will rely on a pre-existing database that directly provides the impacts associated with the production of the coil and the ferromagnetic core. This includes the entire production chain, from raw material extraction to the final product, including transportation from one site to another. In addition, the database provides the environmental impacts resulting from the production of 1 kWh of electricity, using the French electricity mix. This is useful to take into account the impact of energy losses.\n",
