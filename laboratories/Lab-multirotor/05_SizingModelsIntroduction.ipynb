This way, we make sure that the drone is capable of lifting the load and itself. As we are minimizing the total mass $M_{total,real}$ the oversizing coefficient $k_{os}$ will tend to be as small as possible and thus the inequality constraint will be equivalent to an equality constraint ($M_{total} = M_{total,real}$). This is one way of solving an algebraic loop, other methods use numerical solvers or other optimizer-based formulations. The formulation of the optimization problem is the following:\n",
